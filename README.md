## Instructions

> This project uses [daizong](https://github.com/mgenware/daizong) to manage scripts. You need to run scripts through daizong via `yarn r <script>` or `npm run r <script>`.

Start dev build, watch files (no dev server):

```sh
yarn r dev
```

Lint files:

```sh
yarn r lint
```

Lint, build and uglify JavaScript files:

```sh
yarn r build
```

To run a demo page, open `pages/index.html`.
